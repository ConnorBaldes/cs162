 * 		the trip, then will ask the departure time on the first day of the trip and departure time on the last day. Then will ask amount that the 
 * 		airfare was, then if there were any conference or seminar registration fees, then if they rented a car or took a taxi, the hotel expense
 * 		for each day, and finally the amount they spent on meals each day. The program will use that inforation to calculate the amount that the
 * 		person who went on the trip will be reimbursed for that trip. Also the total amount spent on the trip. 
 *
 * Input: Days spent on trip, departure time first day arrival time last day, airfare amount, car rented or taxi taken, hotel expense, meal expense
