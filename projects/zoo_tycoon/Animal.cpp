 * Function:  Animal()
 *
 * Description: Checks to see if an input string is a valid integer, it does this by looping through all the characters in the string and checks the ascii value
 *		to see if it is between the value '0' and '9'. If all the characters in the string are in that range the string is a valid integer. In that case the
 *		the loop is broken and the string is converted into an int and the int value is returned from the function. If the string contains any non int value 
 *		the user is told their input is bad and is re prompted		
 *
 * Parameters: string message: a message that is strored in a string. The message will tell the user what it is they are inputing
 *
 * Pre-Conditions: string message: telling what to input
 * 		   string input: empty variable that will get input value
 *
 * Post-Conditions: int int_input: correctly input string that was converted to an int and is returned from function
